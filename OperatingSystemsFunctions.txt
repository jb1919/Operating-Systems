One function of an operating system is when you power it on. 
While the computer or mobile device is turned off, there is a power button you press to power it on. 
Pressing or holding the power button while the device is on will power it off.
An operating system also has other power options such as sleep mode and hibernate mode.

Another function is the user interface or UI.
A user interface is how you enter instructions and how the information is displayed on the screen.
There are two types of user interfaces; graphical user interface and command line interface.
Graphical user interface is the most common, you interact with menus and visual images by tapping, pointing, touching or clicking to give commands.

Another function is the driver which is short for device driver.
A driver is a program which tells the system how to communicate with a specific device.
Every device connected to the computer, such as a mouse or webcam, requires its own driver.
When you start a computer or connect a device, the operating system will load the driver for that specific device.
